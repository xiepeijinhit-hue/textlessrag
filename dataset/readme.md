#  SV-DOC Dataset
The first bilingual speechâ€“document RAG dataset SV-DOC, containing Chinese and English voice queries aligned with multimodal document content, to foster future research in this direction.


The full dataset is currently under review and will be released once approved. To better illustrate our work, we have published 10 examples for each subset.
